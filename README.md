# Hermes Profiles

Curated Hermes Agent profiles for specialist swarms. Each profile packages a role identity (SOUL.md), skill dependencies, and configuration for a specific architecture/engineering capability that can be deployed as a Hermes agent.

These profiles are **opinionated** — they use Hermes-native patterns:
- Artifact-pyramid output format (progressive disclosure, path-as-handoff)
- skill-based methodology loading (`skill_view` → load references)
- Hermes kanban for multi-agent orchestration
- Hermes profile system for role isolation

The **profiles** (SOUL.md + profile.yaml) are Hermes-specific and unlikely to work
in other harnesses. But the **skills** — the methodology directories in `skills/`
with their SKILL.md + references/ structure — follow the [Agent Skills open
standard](https://www.agensi.io/learn/agent-skills-open-standard) adopted by
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf,
and 20+ other coding agents. Those should work anywhere.

Profiles symlink to the shared `skills/` directory, so one copy of each
skill serves every profile. Git tracks symlinks by reference, not by
duplicating content.

## Using a Profile

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/magnus919/hermes-profiles.git ~/hermes-profiles

# Symlink the profile you want into ~/.hermes/profiles/
# (39 profiles available — pick one)
ln -s ~/hermes-profiles/profiles/researcher ~/.hermes/profiles/

# Switch to profile (skills are bundled — no separate install needed)
hermes --profile researcher
```

Each profile's `profile.yaml` lists its required skills and any Hermes-specific configuration.

## Contributing

Open an issue or PR. Profiles should:
- Have a clear, single responsibility
- Include a SOUL.md with first principles and output contract
- List skill dependencies explicitly
- Be Hermes-native (artifact-pyramid output, skill-based methodology loading)
- Not depend on agent-specific infrastructure (council, cashew, etc.) — these must work on a vanilla Hermes install
